Objective:
 
Using the dipsw to set the 1st and 8th digits of 7 segment display connedted to the Pmod.
The switches sw1 & sw2 when pressed turn off the 1st and 8th digits.
Requirements:
	Hardware
		RPi2B, RPi3B, or RPi3B+.
		CATBOARD
		StickIt!-LedDigits
		http://www.xess.com/shop/product/stickit-leddigits/
			Eight 7-segment LEDs
			Needs only 8 I/O pins!
			PMOD compatible
			Wing compatible
			Open-source design
	Software
		MyHDL
		Yosys
		Arachne-pnr
		Icepack

This demonstrates the use of MyHDL, Yosys, Arachne_pnr, and  Icepack.
This provides a complete Development system that fits in the palm of your
hand.

MyHDL reads a python file and creates the Verilog file that can be used
to create the bitfile that programs the Lattice HX8K FPGA.
The script btn.sh calls yosys with the file catboard.v which creates the 
catboard.blif file. 

Once the Verilog file is created it is a 3 step process to create the bit file used to program
the FPGA.

The script btn.sh calls yosys with the file catboard.v which creates the 
catboard.blif file.

The script btn_pnr.sh calls arachne_pnr with catboard.pcf whichs maps the signals to the pins 
on the FPGA.  In addition the catboard.blif file fron step 1.0 is used.  It then creates the 
Arachne-pnr creates the catboard.txt.
